MOdels for Modality Annotation.</h3>
<h4>Workshop co-located with IWCS 2015</h4>


<p>The notion of modality involves a spectrum of phenomena that are pervasive in language but far from being formalised. For an exhaustive formalisation, a joint effort by computational, corpus, and formal linguists as well as language typologists is required.

<p>Computationally, the automatic identification and interpretation of modalised statements is a prime concern in a large number of applications, especially with the recent attention to opinion mining and social networks. Formally, and from a comparative linguistics perspective, characterisations are sought of the range of modal types and their marking across the languages of the world, towards a complete classification of modal functions. This would yield a thorough understanding of the relations holding between modal categories, and an understanding of the grammatical vs. lexical nature of modal markers across languages.

<p>From a practical perspective, progress in computational methods and tools heavily relies on specific lexical resources and annotated data. Indeed, recent years have witnessed the development of annotation schemes and annotated corpora for different aspects of modality in different languages (McShane et al. (2004); Wiebe et al. (2005); Szarvas et al. (2008); Sauri and Pustejovsky (2009); Hendrickx et al. (2012); Baker et al. (2012); Nissim et al. (2013)). While there have been efforts towards finding a common avenue for modality annotation, such as the CoNLL-2010 Shared Task, ACL thematic workshops and a special issue of Computational Linguistics (Morante and Sporleder, 2012), the computational linguistics community is still far from having developed working, shared standards for converting modality-related issues into annotation categories.

<p>Studies in language typology have come a long way in the identification of functional categories of modality and linguistic realisation in different world languages (de Haan (2005); Hansen and De Haan (2009); Diewald and Smirnova (2010); Mortelmans et al. (2009); Boye (2012); Mauri and Sanso` (2012); Narrog (2012)). Insights from this tradition are crucial for the advancement of computational work on modality, since a comprehensive scheme for producing reliable annotated data must obviously be usable from a computational perspective, but it also has to rely on a solid theoretical base. In other words, a balance must be found between accuracy and detailing in the description of the phenomenon, and preventing proliferation of labels which might cause data to be too sparse to learn from, and also lower agreement among annotators.

<p>In corpus linguistics studies of modality-related phenomena inspired by (Coates, 1983; Biber and Finegan, 1988, 1989), researchers use an incremental method based on redefining categories after as- sessing agreement through several rounds of manual annotation, with the aim of finding the right balance between feasibility and expressivity of categories (Divjak, 2010; Glynn and Sjo ̈lin, 2014).

<p>This is why we deem crucial that researchers from all involved fields join efforts towards defining exhaustive and at the same time usable representations of modality, towards working, implementable annotation standards. Thus, the main aim of this workshop is bringing together researchers from such fields, towards the development of shared, stable annotation standards. We believe IWCS would be an excellent venue for locating this kind of workshop, as it has a strong tradition of bringing together linguistic theory and implementation.
